  <h1>About us</h1>
<p>Systemetric is a robotics team comprising students from the Lower and Upper Sixth (16- to 18-year-olds) at <a href="http://www.hillsroad.ac.uk/">Hills Road Sixth Form College</a> in Cambridge, England. The team was the first from the United Kingdom to enter into the <a href="http://www.firstinspires.org/robotics/frc/">FIRST Robotics Competition</a>, as Team 759, and has now become a regular competitor at the New York City Regional in the United States since our Rookie year in 2002. We remain as one of only two teams from the UK to compete in the competition, and the only team from the UK to compete in the New York City Regional.</p>

<p>The team also acts as a mentor to FIRST Lego League teams within the eastern region of the United Kingdom. Expansion in recent years has seen us regularly participate in other smaller robotics competitions within the UK, including the <a href="https://studentrobotics.org/">Student Robotics</a> competition based at Southampton University, becoming the first team from outside Southampton to participate, and <a href="https://developer.mbed.org/cookbook/mbed-Robot-Racing/">mbed Robot Racing</a> competitions hosted by <a href="https://www.arm.com/">ARM Microprocessors</a>.</p>

<p>The team’s name comes from the metric system of measurement. The words ‘metric’ and ‘system’ were switched around to create the team name (system metric). The name was chosen as reference to the United States continued use of the imperial system of measurement, where the UK has changed to the metric system.</p>
