  <h1>Get involved</h1>
<p>Systemetric is completely self-funded, and depends entirely on corporate sponsorship and donations to be able to build our robots and enter the competitions we participate in. Costs that have to be covered include competition entry fees, international shipping and parts. In 2011 it cost the team $6000 to enter the FIRST Robotics Competition alone, around £3750 at the time, not including the additional costs of shipping and parts. To be able to continue entering in these competitions, we need your support.</p>

<h2 id="corporate-sponsorship">Corporate sponsorship</h2>

<p>A significant amount of our funds are covered by corporate sponsors. Our sponsors’ brands are featured on the team website and on the robots themselves, as well as any publicity material we issue and the shirts worn by the team at events. While participating in the FIRST Robotics Competition, we compete in a very large arena and typically there are several webcasts of the event, including one from NASA.</p>

<p>By sponsoring our team, you will be promoting the technological skills and abilities of budding engineers. You will also provide a truly unique opportunity to allow a British team to compete on a level playing field with teams from all over the globe. If you would be interested in sponsoring the team, please <a href="/contact/">contact us</a></p>

<h2 id="donations">Donations</h2>

<p>You can donate to the team at team events, both in college and out, or at any time by <a href="/contact/">contacting us</a>. Donations of any amount are greatly appreciated.</p>

<h2 id="mentoring">Mentoring</h2>

<p>If you believe you could help the team by providing your services, we would be interested in hearing from you. We can’t take on everyone, but please <a href="/contact/">contact us</a> with your details and the services you can provide to us and we will assess if we will be able to take you on.</p>
